# Object Oriented Programming
# Object Oriented Programming ---> Python is multi-paradigm programming languages. it supports different programmig
# approaches. One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as OOP

# An object has two characteristics :-
# 1). Attributes
# 2). Behavior
# Let's take an example
# A parrot is an object , as it has the following properties :-
# ---->    name , age , color , as attributes
# ----> singing , dancing as behavior

# Common topic in almost all popular programming languages (Python , C++ , Java) with common idea but with different
# syntax

# OOP is just a STYLE/WAY to write code

# Very helpful in creating real world programms

# We will see other advantages when we still start learning OOP


# Key points to remember :-
# Oriented Programming makes the program easy to understand as well as efficient.
# Since the class is sharable , the code can be reused.
# Data is safe and secure with data abstraction.
# Polymorphism allows te same interface for different objects, so programmers can write efficient code.
