# Tuple is a Data Structure
# Tuple can store any data type
# Most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update data inside tuple

# example = ('one',2,"three",4.0)
# We can't use [ ' append , insert , pop , remove '] inside the tuple
# days = ('thurday' , 'friday')

# Tuples are faster than lists

# These methods are used inside the  tuples
# count , index
# len function
# slicing

# print(example [:2])
